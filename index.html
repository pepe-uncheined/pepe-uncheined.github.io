			<h2 class="#Wonderland Timetrade">What is Pepe Unchained?
</h2>

			<p><a href="https://pepe-uncheined.github.io/">Pepe Unchained</a> is a meme coin project building its own Layer-2 blockchain, called Pepe Chain, to address Ethereum's scalability issues. It aims to offer significantly faster transaction speeds and lower fees than Ethereum, making meme coin trading smoother and more efficient. The project's presale has raised significant funds, attracting attention from investors and the broader crypto community.</p>

			<h2 class="#whatdoes">Background and Concept
</h2><p>The project is built on the foundation of the iconic Pepe the Frog meme, which has become a cultural phenomenon in the cryptocurrency space. Pepe Unchained leverages this popularity to attract a community of investors and traders who are interested in meme coins but are frustrated by the limitations of existing platforms. The project positions itself as a solution to the inefficiencies of the Ethereum blockchain, particularly during periods of high demand when transaction fees can skyrocket.
